success through luck can be said as receiving a lot of opportunities, some at the right time

the main learning I have to share is - to place yourself in a position to receive nuggets of wisdom

do the right things, listen to the right sources in your life, and the nuggets will pour in

similarly, if you want the goodness of emergence, you can do certain things to align yourself towards the path of gaining emergence from data

you should position yourself to lessen semantic boundaries, do simple and scalable things, and see intelligence emerge.

another example is to increase your luck surface area by pursuing new experiences and challenges.

i was looking at my obsidian vault - where I write, learn, research, read.

i removed folders and tagging. instead of applying complexity in structuring thought, I applied it in abstraction.

as a result, i made the process of writing and gathering data intuitive.

i don’t fragment ideas into smaller and smaller files, all interlinked together. i write into large files with thousands of words, and see high level thoughts occur.
