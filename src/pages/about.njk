                    <p>I'm Kavin Sood, Computer Science Engineering undergrad student and fullstack developer based in India.</p>
                    <p>My strengths are Math and CS. I'm fascinated by the intersection of core engineering and deep tech, particularly how it's shaping the future of hardware. For the past while, I've maintained reading all about AI, machine learning, decision theory and rationality.</p>

                <p>I've been building things that live on the web for the last 3 years. My focus is on creating engaging, accessible &amp; performant interfaces for humans. I like to freelance and build websites for entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>In the real world, I like to play basketball, lift weights and watch sunsets. My taste in music is diverse and random. Right now - Arctic Monkeys and Tame Impala. I like to read literature and philosophy, but also on personal growth. I like to watch good movies, <a href="https://kavinsood.com/blog/books-and-movies/#h-action-crime-classics">see here.</a></p>
                <p>The tech world of which we are a part is enthralling to me, and I sometimes stop myself from spending day and night; every waking hour, from completely diving onto twitter and substack blogs of tech personas, just learning a thing or two.</p>
                <p>I'm currently looking for research and internship opportunities to gain industry experience.<p>
